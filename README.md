# Ad-hoc Report for 3D Printing Program

Transitioning the 3D printing workflow from pen and paper to an online excel sheet allows us to track the performance of our program and answer a variety of relevant questions. Are ample patrons using this program to justify its existence? Are staff able to complete 3D print requests under our specified timeframe? Are certain 3D prints and colors more popular than others? How has the transition to an online form and automated python programs impacted the program? Answers to these questions can help us make informed decisions on the future of the 3D printing program at the library.  

In order to answer these questions, we obviously need to gather the data. Thankfully transitioning to an online form as I discussed in a separate repository called “PUB-Workflow-3D” made data collecting easy and automatic! Once enough requests were accumulated, I wrote an r program called “3D prints all” to analyze various descriptive statistics. These included frequency graphs to show the most popular print requests and filament color, and average turnaround time from the time of request until we contact the patron that their print was ready. 

Full findings on how transitioning from pen and paper to excel sheets and automation benfited the 3D printing program can be found in the "3D printing report"!
