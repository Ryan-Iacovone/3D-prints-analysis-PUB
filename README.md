**The Findings**


Performing ad hoc analyis on the performance of our 3D printing program. In order to gather valuable insights and imporve our program I looked at the most common types of prints request and thier colors. On the staff side I investigated how changing our workflow from pen and paper to autmated python scripts and an online form over the past couple of months has impacted our efficiency. Gathering all thisinformation otgether in a succicent reports allows accurate reflection on what's working and what's not in order to improve our process not only for patrons wishing to utilize the program but also for staff ensuring effiecicy and time well spent because we don't have much time to give.
